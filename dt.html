# Step 1: Open MongoDB shell using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the Car Showroom information system
use car_showroom_db

# Step 3: Create collections for cars, sections, sales staff, and customers
db.cars.insertMany([

# Step 4: Write the Cypher queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the types of cars available in the showroom
db.cars.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$type" } }
])

# b. List the sections handled by Mr. Narayan
db.sections.aggregate([
  { $match: { sales_staff: "Mr. Narayan" } },
  { $project: { section_name: 1 } }
])

# c. List the names of customers who have done only enquiry but not made any purchase
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $match: { $and: [{ enquiries: { $ne: [] } }, { purchases: { $size: 0 } }] } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# d. List the highly sold car model
db.customers.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$purchases" },
  { $group: { _id: "$purchases", count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 },
  { $project: { model: "$_id", sales_count: "$count" } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB shell
exit
